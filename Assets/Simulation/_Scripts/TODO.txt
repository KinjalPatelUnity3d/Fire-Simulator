1) 3D view of room with zoom where fire extinguisher is and zoom where fire is
2) Instructions appear: Grab the fire extinguisher fast and turn out the flames. Don’t know how to use one? Don’t worry I got you!
3) Indicate that user should grab fire extinguisher if after 5 seconds user does not.
4) User takes fire extinguisher closer to flames: ‘’STAND ABOUT 2 METERS FROM FLAMES.’’ Indicate distance from flame.
5) Zoom camera to top part of Fire Extinguisher to show where the pin is
6) Text appears ‘’PULL PIN’’. Show instruction on screen how to pull the pin. 
7) User pulls pin outside by holding on pin and pull it towards opposite to open it.
8) Once pin pulled camera animates so full view of fire extinguisher can be seen
9) one hand will appear at the handle of fire extinguisher with its position like handle is grabbed,
   while the other hand holding tube, and tube pointing on flames.
10) User AIMS at flames, so this should appear on screen as instruction: AIM AT FLAMES
11) Instruction to SQUEEZE the lever/handle to spray flames, user then clicks on hand which squeezes the lever/handle.
12) User SWEEPS by moving tube from side to side or up and down or back and forth on the flame.
13) Note! Sweeping is done while hand is continuously squeezing the lever/handle.
14) Let user spray flames 3 times. So, after each spray let text appear ‘’SPRAY AGAIN’’ up to user sprays 3 times.
15) Flames go off after user sprays 3 times, text appears on screen ‘’WELL DONE, YOU ARE A HERO’’
16) For all these I think we need a START function, right, so user can restart the process again if they want.
